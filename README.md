This is my take on a Asteroids clone, meant as [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) learning project. It's playable online [here](https://bylr.info/rusteroids/) (Desktop only, click to focus, arrows + spacebar, "E" to download SVG).

The main twist is pure monotone vector graphics with (upcoming) SVG export (using [vsvg](https://github.com/abey79/vsvg)), so screenshots maybe pen plotted:
